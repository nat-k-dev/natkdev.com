            Hello, my name is Natalia.
I'm a frontend developer passionate about creating clean, user-friendly, and responsive web interfaces.
I've worked with technologies like HTML, CSS, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, Angular, and React.
I enjoy building web applications that people find easy to use, and I value being part of projects that have a meaningful impact.
My recent experience includes developing web applications for the healthcare sector â€” helping medical staff, children in intensive care units and families stay connected through intuitive, modern interfaces.
            </p>
            <p className="aboutme__paragraph">I find the most inspiration in building and improving the user-friendly web interfaces and continually improving my frontend skills. Feel free to check out my projects below!</p>
